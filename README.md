# CakeOrders

The start of this project is a basic cake oerdering platforn to help control orders taken in a baking enviroment the progrqam stores
the customers details that can be tracked for each order that they make.

The platform will be developed to let the staff know what cakes or stock needs to be baked for the next day to help organise
the running of the business and allow stock to be baked on time.
There is a long term plan to add more functionality with the whole running of the business in the baking enviroment with many features 
to help stock control.

Once you run the file you will need to create 2 txt files to store the customer and cake details.

Update will be made in due time.
